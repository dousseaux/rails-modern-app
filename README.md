# Modern Rails App

The goal of this project is to showcase a simple modern rails app for those who are used with the old good rails (like I was).

This project features Rails 6 with: react, webpack and graphQL.

Starting:

```
rails new modern-app -d mysql --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-text --skip-spring --skip-turbolinks --webpack=react -T
```
